[{"heading":null,"sub_heading":null,"textarea":"Colleges and universities are frequent and compelling targets for cyber criminals. The industry may face data security risks due to the large number of personal records processed and stored, the mix of intellectual property and personally identifiable information held (e.g., social security numbers and other information required for admission), and the open, collaborative environment of many campuses. The exposure of sensitive information through cybersecurity breaches, other malicious activities, or student negligence may result in significant social externalities such as identity fraud and theft. Data breaches may compromise public perception of the effectiveness of an institution's security measures, which could result in reputational damage and difficulty in attracting and retaining students, as well as significant costs to fix the consequences of a breach and prevent future breaches. Enhanced disclosure on the number and nature of security breaches, management strategies to address these risks, and policies and procedures to protect student information will allow stakeholders to understand the effectiveness of management strategies that institutions employ regarding this issue.\r\n","icon":null},{"heading":null,"sub_heading":null,"textarea":null,"icon":null},{"heading":null,"sub_heading":null,"textarea":null,"icon":null},{"heading":null,"sub_heading":null,"textarea":null,"icon":null}]
