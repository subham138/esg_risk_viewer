[{"heading":"Summary","sub_heading":null,"textarea":"Increasing tuition payments require more students to finance their education with government and private loans. Rapid growth in student debt creates significant economic and social negative\r\nexternalities if student loans go into default. Many programmes at for-profit colleges prepare students for gainful employment in recognised occupations. Entities that provide high-quality education and facilitate completion of programmes increase the chances of graduates obtaining employment and paying their loans. In the absence of sufficient educational and career management support, students s may graduate with high debt and few skills valued by employers. Entities that perform poorly on accountability metrics such as graduation rates, default rates and job placement rates may jeopardise important governmental funding sources. At the same time, transparent disclosure of these metrics to prospective students is related directly to institutionsâ€™ ability to attract and retain students."},{"heading":null,"sub_heading":null,"textarea":null}]
