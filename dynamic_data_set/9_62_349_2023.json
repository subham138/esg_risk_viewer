[{"heading":"Summary","sub_heading":"Data Security","textarea":"Entities in every segment of the industry are entrusted with customer data. Employment and temporary staffing agencies as well as data providers and consulting entities store, process and transmit increasing amounts of sensitive personal data about employees, clients and candidates. In addition, the clients of financial and non-financial services providers may handle sensitive information and share this information with professional and commercial services entities. The exposure of sensitive customer information through cybersecurity breaches, other malicious activities, or employee negligence may result in significant risks such as identity fraud and theft. Data breaches may compromise client perception of the effectiveness of a service provider’s security measures, which may result in reputational damage and affect an entity’s ability to attract and retain clients adversely."},{"heading":"Exposure","sub_heading":"Cost of data breach by country or region (USD millions)","textarea":"Sources: IBM Security (2021, 2022, 2023).
