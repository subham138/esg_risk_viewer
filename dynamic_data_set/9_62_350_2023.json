[{"heading":"Summary","sub_heading":"Employee Engagement, Diversity & Inclusion","textarea":"Developing a broad base of valued, respected and supported employees throughout \r\nan organisation is essential for the long-term growth prospects of professional and commercial services entities. Human capital \r\nis the primary source of revenue generation, contributing knowledge, talent, advice, and various technical skills. Although financial and non-financial service providers may hire a diverse workforce among lower-level \r\nemployees, they may lack diversity among senior management. Enhancing workforce diversity, particularly among \r\nmanagement positions, may help entities attract and develop the best talent. Significant employee \r\nengagement, fair treatment and equitable levels of pay and advancement opportunities for all workers are all likely to \r\ncontribute to increased productivity and performance through all levels of the entity."}]
