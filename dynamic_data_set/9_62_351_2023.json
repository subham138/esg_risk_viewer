[{"heading":"Summary","sub_heading":"Business Ethics","textarea":"The business model of professional and commercial services entities is dependent on client trust and loyalty. To ensure long-term and mutually beneficial relationships, entities must provide services that meet the highest professional standards of the industry. Professional integrity is an important industry governance issue because the collective actions of professionals inside a single organisation may make the detection and prevention of conflicts of interest, bias or negligence more challenging. Training employees adequately, providing advice and distributing data free from bias and error, and taking other measures to ensure professional integrity are important both for strengthening an entityâ€™s licence to operate as well as for attracting and retaining clients."}]
