[{"heading":"Summary","sub_heading":"Selling Practices & Product Labeling","textarea":"Entities have a legal responsibility to ensure their products and services advertising  is truthful and not deceptive. Although much of the regulatory compliance burden regarding advertising content and placement lies with the client, advertising agencies play a vital role in the creation of advertising content and are responsible for advising clients regarding applicable regulations. \r\nConsumer protection laws provide guidance and restrictions on advertising to children and on advertising regulated products, such as alcohol and tobacco. Regulators may investigate advertising agency involvement in deceptive advertising and penalise the agency. Advertising and marketing entities exposed to these regulations and concerns have responded by participating in self-regulatory programmes that manage these areas."}]
